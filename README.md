# üìò final-project-stsci6020-2025

This project investigates how various lifestyle and behavioral factors affect students' academic performance using a synthetic dataset. Linear regression and variable selection techniques are applied to quantify the influence of different predictors on final exam scores.

## üìå Introduction

This project explores how habits such as study time, sleep, exercise, and screen time relate to academic outcomes. Using a simulated dataset of 1,000 students from Kaggle, the analysis includes:

- Fitting linear regression models to predict exam scores
- Checking and correcting regression assumptions
- Performing variable selection using:
  - **Branch and Bound (best subset selection)**
  - **LASSO regression (with cross-validation)**
- Interpreting the practical impact of each predictor
